# odin-admin-dashboard

This project is a practice exercise for creating a dashboard layout using CSS Grid. The goal is to build a functional, visually organized interface with nested grid structures and proper layout of sidebar, header, and main content sections.

## Project Overview

1. The dashboard consists of three main sections:

2. Sidebar: Contains navigation links, branding, and menu items.

3. Header: Includes a search bar, user profile info, and action buttons.

Main Content: Displays projects, announcements, and trending items.

Nested grids are used within these sections to align content effectively and practice CSS Grid skills.

## Features

* Fully built with HTML and CSS Grid.

* Nested grid layouts for sidebar navigation, header items, and main content.

* Responsive-ish layout for demo purposes (optional: cards can expand/shrink).

* Placeholder images and text used for layout visualization.

* Distinct colors and borders applied to sections to help visualize grid areas during development.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5

* CSS3

* CSS Grid for layout

* SVG icons from Material Design Icons


## Notes

This project focuses on practicing CSS Grid layout and nested grids.

Placeholder images and text were used for demonstration; these can be replaced with real content.

Responsive design is optional; the main goal is mastering grid layouts and content alignment.

Use of background-color or border properties to help debug and visualize grid areas while building.
